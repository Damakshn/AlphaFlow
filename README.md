# AlphaFlow

This project is for self-education, its goal is to comprehend how to design event-oriented systems in a clean and reliable way.

Learning scope:
- Designing data pipelines via Apache Kafka;
- Basic patterns for microservice architecture and event-oriented systems;
- Designing clean and testable background services;
- Basics of observability and monitoring;
- Integration testing for event-oriented systems with external dependencies;
- Clean and reliable project settings for various environments;
- Containerisation;
- Probably CI/CD;

The desired system is not meant to have complex business rules or to be implemented according to DDD (like [AlphaTest](https://github.com/Damakshn/AlphaTest)), the final purpose of the system is just sophisticated juggling some pieces of data using specific patterns and technologies. Possibility of practical usage and realism are not important.
